# core-treasury

Classes related to the concept of a `Player` having a treasury of a `Yield`.

This could probably benefit from a bit of a rewrite having multiple stores of `Yield`s (`Gold`, `Faith`, etc) that can
be spent.

It would also be nice to separate out the concepts of "buy" and "rush". This would also enable the (Civ 2?) concept of
sacrificing population to build items quickly.

Would be nice to add some core unit tests here too.
